            <h1> About Rodessa</h1>

            <p> Besides my obvious education and work background, I have many interests and hobbies that I enjoy in my
                free time. Some of which include DIY projects, painting, and drawing. Recently, I've been into building
                things. I took a stage managment class in undergrad and really became familiar with using power tools.
                My wedding is coming up, so I used the opportunity to make my centerpieces. I've done some wood work,
                stained, and died over 1000 flowers. It's been time consuming, but so much fun. I also enjoy making bath
                and body products. To the point where I had a legit business. I started in 2018, but finally threw in
                the towel in 2022. Grad school. I still enjoy making small batches of product when I have time. </p>
